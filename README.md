# light-reactor
An experimental art installation that any number of people can create and explore with together

## Project Goals

- Be big, bright, brilliant, and bring people together
- Allow any number of people to affect the system at a time. Instead of a specialized input device that as limited number of people can use at a time--leaving others to observe and wait--the input will be anything that emits bright light
- Provide an obvious baseline link between cause and effect that leads into exploration, discovery, and sharing of more elaborate cause and effect
